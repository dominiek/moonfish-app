# Moonfish App

Moonfish is an open source platform for doing Token Sales and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).

## Install Dependencies

Run in the project root folder:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Run

The following command serves all HTML/JS/CSS and watches all changes to `src/*.js`

```bash
yarn start
```

UI is running at [http://localhost:1305/](http://localhost:1305/)

## Directory Structure

* `package.json` - Configure dependencies
* `webpack.config.js` - Bundling and build configuration
* `dist/*` - Files generated by webpack, incuding index.html. These are the assets that should be HTTP served
* `src/utils` - Home of specific JS helper utilities like for example `request.js` for doing API requests
* `src/components` - Home of all React components
* `src/containers/*` - Components that are tightly coupled to the app pages
* `src/index.js` - Main entrypoint into application. Multi-app or sub-domain specific apps/logic could be implemented here.
